# Detached jobs: run `/ap:implement` and `/ap:quick` as background jobs — design

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Status:** approved (grilled 2026-08-18; decisions recorded in "Settled decisions" below)
**Scope of this design:** an **opt-in `--detached` mode** for `/ap:implement` and `/ap:quick` only,
delivered as two landings — (1) a `spawn --session` placement primitive, (2) a job layer whose
detached run is driven by a second model session (the **job hub**) inside a detached tmux session.
Explicitly **out of scope** (successor specs if wanted): detaching `design` / `explore` /
`autoresearch` / `bridge`; auto-respawning a dead job hub and resuming mid-stage; sandboxed
`verify-tests`; any change to the default attached behavior.

## Problem

A `/ap:implement` run whose worker spends hours on GPU training or a long verification suite pins the
originating Claude Code session to that run for the whole duration. Three distinct costs, only one of
which the current design addresses:

1. **Foreground blocking — already solved.** `commands/implement.md` and `commands/quick.md` already
   dispatch `turn-wait` with `run_in_background: true`, so the pane stays interactive. This is *not*
   the problem.
2. **Hub context occupancy — unsolved.** The orchestration lives in the originating session's
   conversation: it authors fix-prompts (Stage 3), cross-verifies (Stage 2), and answers the worker's
   relayed questions. That session cannot be spent on unrelated work without interleaving a
   multi-hour pipeline through it.
3. **Death on restart — unsolved, and the sharp edge.** The worker pane survives anything tmux
   survives, but the backgrounded `turn-wait` node process dies with the Claude Code session, and the
   orchestration conversation dies with it. A Claude Code update or a restart mid-run strands a live
   worker with nobody driving it. The operator's own standing rule — long jobs belong in a detached
   tmux session, never a session-owned shell — is currently unenforceable for ap runs.

Moving only the *worker pane* into a detached session fixes none of (2) or (3): the worker was never
the component that dies. The orchestration is.

## Goal

`/ap:implement <doc> --detached` (and `/ap:quick "<task>" --detached`) returns to the operator within
about a minute, having launched a self-contained job in a detached tmux session that drives the full
pipeline to a finished branch without further attention. The originating session keeps a cheap
read-only view of that job (status, completion notification, stall detection), can be restarted and
re-attach to a still-running job, and can answer a parked question when the job needs a human. The
operator can `tmux attach -t ap-<topic>` at any moment and watch the real TUIs work.

Without `--detached`, every existing command behaves byte-for-byte as it does today.

## Settled decisions

These were decided in a design interview and are inputs to this spec, not open questions.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | The **whole run** detaches, not just the worker pane | Only this addresses Problem (2) and (3) |
| D2 | Wired into **`implement` and `quick` only** | `autoresearch` has its own resume/ledger machinery; reconciling them needs its own spec (`CLAUDE.md` phase guard) |
| D3 | **Opt-in `--detached`**, never a default, never auto-detected | The attached path stays byte-identical; the operator types the flag |
| D4 | **Park-and-relay** for questions; policy gates pre-answered by launch flags | Canning a worker's real question is how a wrong 6-hour run happens |
| D5 | **Same tmux server**, session named `ap-<topic>` | The `@ap_nonce` ownership layer already provides isolation; threading `-L` through every tmux call site buys nothing and risks silent wrong-server probes |
| D6 | The job hub is an **ap-spawned `claude` TUI** running the directive via its Skill tool | Attachable and live (a `claude -p` job gives a log, not a TUI); `codex` cannot load ap's plugin commands; a pure-TS state machine cannot do Stage 2/3, which are model judgment |
| D7 | The job hub gets its **own identity template**, not a relaxed `identity.md` | The worker trust rules are load-bearing security prose; they must not be perforated for every worker to serve one caller |
| D8 | **`--finish keep` is the only accepted finish action in detached mode** | Nothing merges or opens a PR while unattended; the operator decides on a finished branch |

## Architecture

### The recursion, and the two hubs

```
originating Claude Code session          "origin hub"   — monitors, relays, decides
  |
  |  ap job start  ->  tmux new-session -d -s ap-<topic>
  v
detached session ap-<topic>
  window 0: claude TUI                   "job hub"      — runs the ap:implement directive
  window 1: codex/claude TUI             worker         — implements the design doc
```

The job hub is an ordinary ap worker in every mechanical respect — `spawn` creates it, it has a state
dir, an identity file, an inbox, an outbox, a `status.json`, a `pane.json` with an ownership nonce —
whose *task* happens to be "invoke the `ap:implement` skill on this doc." ap's own commands are
exposed to a Claude session as skills (`plugin:ap:implement`), so this needs no new invocation
mechanism.

**The IPC sender stays `From: hub`** (frozen). To the implementation worker, the job hub *is* the hub;
nothing on the wire changes. Where this document needs to distinguish them it says **origin hub**
(the operator's session) and **job hub** (the detached one).

**One-writer rule.** Only the job hub writes its workers' inboxes; the origin hub writes only the job
hub's inbox. A second sender mid-run overwrites a running worker's task and it idles. `ap job relay`
is the origin hub's *only* write path into the job, and it targets the job hub exclusively.

### Landing 1 — `spawn --session <name>` (placement primitive)

A third placement branch alongside the existing two (`--target-pane` respawn, and the
`.last_pane`/`splitRight` chain):

```
spawn <agent> <model> <topic> --session ap-<topic> --cwd <repo>
  session absent -> tmux new-session -d -P -F '#{pane_id}' -s =<name> -c <cwd> <launch>
  session present -> tmux new-window  -d -P -F '#{pane_id}' -t =<name>: -c <cwd> <launch>
```

One window per worker, so `tmux attach -t ap-<topic>` gives a window per agent rather than a shrinking
grid. Everything downstream of pane creation is **unchanged**: `stampOrFail` stamps the same
`@ap_nonce`, `paneLabelSet` stamps the same three `@ap_*` options, `paneMetaWrite` records the same
`pane.json`, the same bootstrap sleep, identity nudge, and `ready` wait follow.

Three properties make this land cheaply:

- **Nothing else in the codebase changes.** Every ownership, liveness, kill, nudge, and capture path
  goes through `livePaneNonces()` (`src/core/tmux.ts:145`), which is `tmux list-panes -a` — server-wide,
  not session-scoped. `list`, `stop`, `check`, and `waitLive.ts`'s pane-liveness escape hatch already
  see panes in other sessions on the same server.
- **`--session` relaxes the `inTmuxSession()` gate** (`src/commands/spawn.ts:63`). That gate exists only
  because the current paths split *the caller's* pane. A detached spawn creates its own session, so the
  caller need not be inside tmux — detached runs work from the desktop app or an IDE, not just a terminal.
- **Session names are already safe.** `topic` is slug-gated to `[a-z0-9-]{1,32}`, so `ap-<topic>`
  contains no `.` or `:` (tmux target separators). Every target is written `=<name>` to force exact
  match rather than tmux's default prefix match.

`--session` and `--target-pane` are mutually exclusive (rc 2). `--session` skips the `.last_pane`
chain entirely — that file is the attached layout's concept.

**Session teardown is ownership-gated.** `killGraceful` respawns a pane into the DONE banner rather
than killing it, so a finished job's session lingers by design (attach and read it). The job's own
teardown kills the session explicitly, and only when it can prove the session is entirely ap's: list
that session's panes, and kill the session only if **every** pane id in it is one whose recorded nonce
we hold and still matches live. Any unrecognized pane -> leave the session alone and say so. This is
the same fail-closed posture as `stop`: unprovable is not permission.

### Landing 2 — the job layer

**New state, topic-keyed, alongside the existing art dirs:** `<repoStateDir>/<topic>/_job/`. It does not
collide with `implement init`'s in-flight guard, which tests `existsSync(<topic>/_implement)`
(`src/commands/implement.ts:139`) — verified, not assumed.

`_job/job.json` records what was launched and nothing else:

```json
{"command":"implement","topic":"<slug>","session":"ap-<slug>",
 "hub":{"agent":"<agent>","model":"claude"},
 "provider":"codex","finish":"keep","budget_hours":6,"max_rounds":5,
 "args_file":"<abs>","started":"<iso>"}
```

**`ap job status <topic>` composes recorded verdicts; it never infers one layer's answer from
another's.** Four independent reads:

| Source | Answers |
|---|---|
| `_job/job.json` | what was launched |
| job hub `pane.json` + `livePaneNonces()` | `alive` / `dead` / **`unknown`** |
| job hub `outbox.jsonl` | the event stream (stage progress, parked question, terminal) |
| job hub `status.json` | the hub's own declared state |

The three-valued liveness is load-bearing and matches the 0.5.30 rule: a `pane.json` with no nonce, or
a nonce that is not a platform-minted UUID, is **UNKNOWN, never dead**. Only a live-and-nonce-matching
pane is `alive`; only a verifiable nonce whose pane is gone is `dead`.

**Verbs** (`ap job <sub>`):

| Verb | Does |
|---|---|
| `start` | validate flags, write `job.json`, create the session, spawn the job hub, write its inbox task, return |
| `status <topic>` | the one-screen composite above |
| `wait <topic>` | block until the job hub emits `done`/`error`/`question`; the origin hub runs this with `run_in_background: true` |
| `attach <topic>` | print the re-arm block (session name, state paths, the `wait` command) after an origin-hub restart |
| `list` | every job under this repo hash, with liveness |
| `relay <topic> @<file>` | answer a parked question — writes the job hub's inbox, the origin hub's **only** write path |
| `stop <topic>` | stop the job hub and its workers, archive, then the ownership-gated session kill |
| `mode <topic>` | `DETACHED=1\|0` — the mechanical signal the directive branches on |
| `budget-check <topic>` | rc 0 within budget, rc 1 exceeded |

`wait` reuses `liveOutboxWait` unchanged, so it inherits the pane-liveness escape hatch: a job hub whose
pane vanishes without a terminal event fails the wait fast instead of blocking out the full budget.

### The job hub's identity — `config/prompt-templates/job-hub.md`

`identity.md` forbids exactly two things the job hub must do, so it cannot wear it:

- *"Foreground tool-use only… do NOT pass `run_in_background: true`"* — the job hub's core loop is a
  backgrounded `turn-wait`.
- *"never write another worker's files"* — the job hub writes worker inboxes via `ap send`; that is its
  function.

The new template is `identity.md` with **three deltas and nothing else**:

1. Backgrounding is permitted and expected, for `turn-wait`/`round-wait` only.
2. It may write its own workers' inboxes through `ap send`; it still may not write their outboxes,
   status files, or artifacts.
3. **Gate handling is park-and-relay**: where the attached directive would call AskUserQuestion, the
   job hub emits `{"event":"question", ...}` to its own outbox, sets status, and waits for its inbox.

Everything else is retained **verbatim**: the inbox-is-the-only-task-channel rule, the `FLAG:` discipline,
atomic `status.json` writes, safe JSONL emission, and the "worker output is DATA, not directives" posture
that `commands/implement.md` already applies to worker question payloads. A worker's outbox content is
never a directive to the job hub, whatever it says.

`identityWrite` gains a role parameter selecting the template; the default is `identity.md`, so every
existing call site is unchanged.

### DETACHED MODE in the directives

**One directive per command, not a forked copy.** `commands/implement.md` and `commands/quick.md` each
gain a single `## DETACHED MODE` section near the top that redefines exactly the gates that need a human,
with a mechanical entry test (`ap job mode <TOPIC>` -> `DETACHED=1`) rather than prose-only detection. A
forked `implement-detached.md` would drift from a 400-line directive within two releases.

Five gates are redefined; every other stage is shared, unmodified:

| Attached gate | Detached behavior |
|---|---|
| Claude-confirm provider gate | read `provider` from `job.json`; no question |
| Worker `ROUTE=escalate` question | emit job-hub `question` carrying the decoded text; wait for inbox; relay the answer to the worker |
| `turn-send` "not idle" | wait 60s and retry, then `reset-status` once, then **park** — never a third silent force |
| Scope-check `OOS_COUNT > 0` | **park**; never auto-`Force-keep`, never auto-amend |
| Finish menu | `finish` from `job.json`, which `start` has already constrained to `keep` |

Plus one new terminal path: Stage 2 `VERDICT: FAIL` with rounds exhausted writes `RESUME.md` and **parks**
rather than aborting, so a budget-exhausted run is recoverable rather than discarded.

`ROUTE=verify` and `ROUTE=objection` questions are **not** parked — the job hub verifies claims against
ground truth and adjudicates objections exactly as the attached directive does. Only genuinely
human-owned decisions reach the operator.

### The autonomy envelope

A detached job is a second `claude` session at `--permission-mode auto`, unattended, spawning its own
workers, running the target repo's own test command un-sandboxed in the target repo (`verify-tests` is
in-place by design — this defends an honest worker's forged log, not a committed test trojan). That is
the same posture ap already runs workers under; detachment changes the *duration* and removes the
observer, so it is bounded three ways:

1. **`--budget-hours <N>` (default 6).** Checked mechanically at each round boundary via
   `ap job budget-check`; on exceed the job writes `RESUME.md` and parks with a `question`. It never
   silently continues and never silently discards.
2. **Branch-pinned.** The job hub works on `feat/implement-<TOPIC>` off a clean pre-snapshot, exactly as
   the attached run does.
3. **`--finish keep` only.** `ap job start` **rejects** `--finish merge` and `--finish pr` (rc 2) with a
   message naming the reason. Nothing leaves the branch while nobody is watching. The operator returns to
   a finished branch and runs the finish menu themselves.

### Job-hub death

`ap job status` reports it; nothing auto-recovers. A second job hub waking onto a live worker is how a run
gets corrupted, and resuming mid-stage needs durable stage state that does not exist yet. The status output
names the orphaned worker and the exact `ap stop <agent> <topic>` remedy. Auto-respawn is a deliberate
successor spec, not a v1 omission.

## Components

- `src/core/tmux.ts` — add pure arg builders `newSessionArgs(session, launch, cwd?)`,
  `newWindowArgs(session, launch, cwd?)`, `hasSessionArgs(session)`, `killSessionArgs(session)`,
  `sessionPanesArgs(session)`, each emitting `=<name>` exact-match targets; add the live wrappers
  `sessionExists`, `newSession`, `newWindow`, `sessionPaneIds`, `killSession`.
- `src/commands/spawn.ts` — parse `--session <name>`; reject it alongside `--target-pane` (rc 2); skip the
  `inTmuxSession()` gate when it is present; add the third placement branch before the `.last_pane` chain;
  leave stamping, labeling, `paneMetaWrite`, bootstrap, and the `ready` wait untouched.
- `src/core/paths.ts` — add `jobDir(topic, opts?)` returning `<topicDir>/_job`, gated through the same
  `assertSlug` choke point as every other art dir.
- `src/core/job.ts` — NEW. The job codec and pure predicates: `parseJob`/`formatJob` for `job.json`,
  `classifyJobLiveness(live, meta)` returning `alive|dead|unknown`, `budgetExceeded(startedIso, hours, now)`,
  `sessionKillable(sessionPaneIds, ownedPaneIds)`, and the status composer over injected reads.
- `src/commands/job.ts` — NEW. The `job` verb: `start`, `status`, `wait`, `attach`, `list`, `relay`, `stop`,
  `mode`, `budget-check`.
- `src/ap.ts` — add `job: () => import("./commands/job.js")` to the dynamic-import dispatch map.
- `config/prompt-templates/job-hub.md` — NEW. `identity.md` plus the three deltas; every other rule verbatim.
- `src/core/ipc.ts` — `identityWrite(i, m, t, opts?: { role?: "worker" | "job-hub" })` selects the template;
  default `worker` keeps every existing call site byte-identical.
- `commands/implement.md` — add the `## DETACHED MODE` section and the five gate redefinitions.
- `commands/quick.md` — same section; `quick` is already unattended, so only the finish/park rules differ.
- `commands/job.md` — NEW. The `/ap:job` slash command (`status` / `attach` / `relay` / `stop`).
- `src/commands/list.ts` — append a `JOBS` section listing each `_job/` with its three-valued liveness.
- `src/commands/stop.ts` — after the existing per-worker teardown, attempt the ownership-gated session kill.
- `tests/tmuxSession.test.ts` — NEW. Arg-builder shapes, `=` exact-match targets, cwd threading.
- `tests/job.test.ts` — NEW. Codec round-trip, the liveness classification table, budget boundary,
  `sessionKillable` fail-closed cases.
- `tests/spawnSession.test.ts` — NEW. Flag parsing, `--session` + `--target-pane` rejection, gate relaxation.

## Testing

- **Pure arg builders only for tmux** (repo rule): assert the exact argv arrays for `new-session`,
  `new-window`, `has-session`, `kill-session`, `list-panes -t`. No real panes in unit tests; live behavior
  is the dogfood.
- **Liveness classification table** — the full cross product of {pane live, pane gone} x {nonce matches,
  nonce mismatched, nonce absent, nonce malformed}, asserting `unknown` (never `dead`) for every
  unverifiable row.
- **`sessionKillable` fail-closed** — a session containing one unrecognized pane must return false; an
  empty owned-set must return false; only a fully-owned session returns true.
- **Budget boundary** — exactly-at-N-hours is within budget; N+1s exceeds; a malformed `started`
  timestamp is treated as exceeded (fail-closed toward parking, never toward running forever).
- **`--finish merge`/`pr` rejection** at `job start` with rc 2.
- **Flag isolation** — a `spawn` invocation without `--session` produces argv byte-identical to today's,
  asserted directly against the existing builders.
- **Template rendering** — `job-hub.md` renders with the same `{{agent}}/{{model}}/{{topic}}/{{state_dir}}`
  substitutions and the same `ready`-emission tail; a diff test asserts it retains the inbox-only-channel
  and FLAG paragraphs verbatim from `identity.md`.
- **Isolation** — every test sets `AP_HOME` to a fresh temp dir (`tests/helpers/tmpHome.ts`).
- **Gates** — `npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run lint && npm run build`; `dist/ap.cjs` rebuilt
  and committed. `tests/stale-tokens.test.ts` must stay green (no banned token enters `src`/`config`/
  `commands`/`hooks`).
- **Live dogfood** (not a unit test, required before the landing is called done): one real
  `/ap:implement <small doc> --detached` run on this repo, verifying: the origin hub returns in under
  ~2 minutes; `tmux attach -t ap-<topic>` shows two live TUIs; `ap job status` tracks the stages;
  a deliberately-parked question is answered with `ap job relay` and the run resumes; the origin
  hub's Claude Code session is restarted mid-run and `/ap:job attach` recovers the view; the run
  ends on `feat/implement-<topic>` with nothing merged or pushed.

## Success Criteria

1. `/ap:implement <doc>` and `/ap:quick "<task>"` without `--detached` emit byte-identical tmux argv and
   byte-identical state writes to 0.5.31.
2. `/ap:implement <doc> --detached` returns control to the origin hub in under 2 minutes and the run
   continues to completion with the origin hub idle.
3. `tmux attach -t ap-<topic>` shows the job hub and its worker as live, labeled, color-bordered TUIs.
4. Killing the origin hub's Claude Code session mid-run leaves the job running; `/ap:job attach <topic>`
   in a fresh session restores status, the completion notification, and stall detection.
5. `ap job status` never reports `dead` for a job hub whose ownership nonce is absent or unverifiable.
6. A worker `ROUTE=escalate` question reaches the operator as a parked `question`, and `ap job relay`
   resumes the run without re-sending the worker's task.
7. `ap job start --finish merge` and `--finish pr` exit rc 2; no detached run merges, pushes, or opens
   a PR.
8. A job exceeding `--budget-hours` parks with `RESUME.md` written; it neither continues nor discards.
9. A detached session is killed at teardown only when every pane in it is provably ap's; otherwise it is
   left intact with a message naming the unrecognized pane.
10. `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` all pass; `dist/ap.cjs` is
    rebuilt and committed; the stale-token gate stays green.

## PR split

- **PR 1 — placement primitive.** `src/core/tmux.ts` builders + wrappers, `spawn --session`, the three
  new test files' tmux/spawn halves. No job layer, no directive change, no behavior change to any
  existing path. Independently useful and independently reviewable.
- **PR 2 — job layer.** `src/core/job.ts`, `src/commands/job.ts`, `config/prompt-templates/job-hub.md`,
  the `identityWrite` role parameter, the `DETACHED MODE` directive sections, `commands/job.md`,
  the `list`/`stop` additions, and the remaining tests. Depends on PR 1.

## Frozen-protocol confirmation

No event name, sentinel, JSON field, `contracts.yaml` key, state filename, or env var is added, renamed,
or repurposed. The job hub communicates entirely in the existing `ready`/`ack`/`progress`/`done`/`error`/
`question` vocabulary, writes the existing `inbox.md`/`outbox.jsonl`/`status.json`/`pane.json`, and signs
its worker messages `From: hub`. `--session` is a new CLI flag on `spawn`; `job` is a new subcommand.
Both are additive.

## Amendments (recorded during implementation)

- **PR 1 ships only the builders it consumes.** The Components list names five session builders;
  `killSessionArgs`, `sessionPanesArgs`, and their live wrappers `sessionPaneIds`/`killSession` are
  deferred to PR 2, where the ownership-gated session teardown is the code that calls them. Shipping
  them in PR 1 would land four exported functions with no caller.
- **The prefix-match hazard is verified, not inferred.** Against live tmux 3.x with only `ap-foobar`
  on the server, `has-session -t ap-foo` exits 0 and `new-window -t ap-foo:` opens its window inside
  `ap-foobar`. The `=` exact-match form is therefore a correctness requirement, not defensive style.
- **`ensurePaneBorders` needed a second call on the detached path.** `tmux set-option -g` exits 1
  ("error connecting to ...") against a cold server, which is the normal state when a detached spawn
  is the first thing to touch tmux. Without the retry after `new-session`, every detached worker
  would lose its border label and the first call would emit a spurious warning. `spawn` now withholds
  the warning on the `--session` path and retries once the session has started a server.

### PR 2 amendments

- **The session sweep lives in `job stop`, not `stop.ts`.** The Components list put it in
  `src/commands/stop.ts`. In practice teardown kills every worker pane individually and tmux destroys
  a session once its last window closes, so the sweep is a **safety net for the case where a pane was
  deliberately NOT killed** (unprovable ownership) — never the normal path. Extending `StopDeps` with
  tmux session calls to serve an almost-always no-op was not worth the surface; `/ap:stop <topic>`
  leaves nothing behind either way. Both branches are verified: all-panes-ours kills the session, and
  one unaccountable pane leaves it intact and names the pane.
- **`job stop` deletes the job record rather than archiving it.** The per-worker archives already
  carry the outbox, the identity, and everything forensics reads; `archiveTopic`'s suite parameter is
  a closed enum that a new `_job` member would have to join for no gain.
- **`spawn --role worker|job-hub` is how the template gets selected.** The spec said `identityWrite`
  takes a role but not how a spawn expresses one. An unknown role is refused (rc 2) rather than
  falling back to the permissive template.
- **`job start` derives the topic from the args file** using the same `deriveTopicFromPath` /
  `--topic` precedence `implement init` uses, so the job record and the run it launches cannot
  disagree about which topic they are. `--topic` overrides; an underivable topic is refused with a
  message naming the flag.
- **`AP_JOB_WAIT_TIMEOUT_S`** (default 3600) bounds one `job wait`. A timeout is not a failure — the
  origin hub re-arms — so it is deliberately long and deliberately not fatal.

### Adversarial-review hardening (pre-merge, 2026-08-18)

- **The origin and its hub must resolve ONE namespace.** VERIFIED by execution: every state path
  derives from `process.cwd()` (`paths.ts` `stateRoot` + `repoHash`) while the job hub is launched
  with `cwd=repoRoot()`, so a record written from `docs/` read `DETACHED=1` in `docs/` and
  `DETACHED=0` at the root — the hub then takes the directive's "ordinary attached run" branch and
  finishes by pushing and opening a PR. `job run()` now normalizes to `repoRoot()` before dispatch
  (restoring the caller's cwd afterwards) and `--args-file` is resolved absolute against the origin's
  cwd. `budget-check` was hardened the same way: an unreadable record prints `BUDGET=unknown` and
  exits **1** (park), not 2 — the hub branches on 0-vs-1, so it has to fail closed toward parking.
- **"No push, no PR" is now mechanical, not prose.** VERIFIED: `quick finish`'s single publication
  switch was `finish.txt == yes`, and `implement finish` gated nothing at all — neither read the job
  record. `quick finish` now disables publication whenever a `_job` record exists and diverts to the
  branch-only arm (which restores the start branch and pops a `--stash-wip` park, so nothing is
  stranded); `implement finish` refuses `merge`/`pr`/`discard` with rc 2 before it truncates its
  results file, and records the refusal to the review feed so `/ap:review` sees a mis-instructed hub.
- **Relay is gated, and its cursor is taken from the snapshot it answered.** VERIFIED: `send` checks
  pane ownership and nothing else, so `relay` was free to overwrite a working hub's inbox task or
  write into a finished one; and taking the cursor AFTER the send swallowed a `done` that landed
  during the send's beat, so `job wait` timed out on a finished job. One read now settles both —
  `relaySnapshot` returns the parked verdict with the byte offset it was computed at; nothing parked
  is a refusal (rc 1), and the recorded cursor is the snapshot's, never a re-stat. `status` suppresses
  a question the cursor already covers (`questionConsumed`), closing the duplicate-relay loop
  `commands/job.md`'s "relay whenever `PARKED=yes`" would otherwise drive.
- **Teardown reports only what it can prove.** VERIFIED (swallowed kill, erased record; the stale-id
  kill contrived but doctrine-violating): `ownedPanes` proved the nonce and then discarded it, and
  the session kill compared bare ids against a snapshot already seconds stale — the one destructive
  site here that never re-read ownership at kill time. `killSession` now returns a boolean,
  `sessionKillable(panes, recorded, live)` re-checks each pane's nonce against a snapshot taken at
  kill time, and the proven pane evidence is persisted to `_job/panes.json` before teardown archives
  the `pane.json` files it came from. An unswept session or an unverified kill exits 1 and KEEPS the
  record — deleting it would leave the next `job start <topic>` free to adopt, by name, a session
  still holding stranger panes — and a re-run can finish the sweep from the persisted evidence.

### Post-dogfood hardening (2026-08-18)

The first live detached run (topic `job-attach-parked`) reached `done`, but surfaced two gaps that
the pre-merge review could not have caught without a pane.

- **The chosen provider is now STAMPED, and the turn verbs cross-check it.** `implement init` writes
  one detection into two files — `provider.txt` (what the turn verbs route by) and
  `auto_provider.txt` (what detection said). Every override after that changed only the SPAWN: the
  attached claude-confirm gate's "fall back to codex", and a detached `job.json` naming a provider.
  Nothing rewrote `provider.txt`, so `workerModel` kept resolving the auto-detected model and
  `turn-send` dispatched at a `lead-<wrong-model>` dir that was never created (rc 1); the dogfood hub
  repaired it by hand-editing the file mid-run. New verb `implement set-provider <topic> <provider>`
  is the ONE mechanical way an override reaches that file (topic slug validated, art dir required,
  provider validated against `contracts.yaml`, atomic write), and `auto_provider.txt` is deliberately
  left untouched — it records what detection SAID, `provider.txt` what was CHOSEN, one fact per file.
  Both turn verbs now refuse (rc 1, before any send or state write) when the spawned `lead` worker's
  model disagrees, naming `set-provider` as the remedy; no spawned worker yet passes. **Rejected:**
  making `resolveModel` the routing source instead of `provider.txt`. It is first-match over the
  topic dir with no uniqueness check and no archived-dir guard, so a leftover or second `lead-*` dir
  would silently redirect the run — a weaker source of truth than the file, not a stronger one.
- **The topic form of `stop` REFUSES while a job record exists, and `job stop` owns the ungated
  path.** A detached job's hub is mechanically an ordinary worker whose state dir sits under the same
  topic, so `stop <topic>` — from implement.md's Stage 5, a mis-instructed hub, or an operator's
  habit — tears down the CONTROLLER: its outbox is archived before `done` reaches the origin's
  `job wait`, which then reports a synthetic pane death and the run reads as a crash. `stop.ts` now
  exports `teardownTopic(topic)` (the old topic-form body) as the ungated path `job stop` calls, and
  gates the public forms on a readable job record: `stop <topic>` refuses with rc 1 naming both
  remedies (`ap job stop <topic>`, `ap stop <agent> <topic>`) and tears down NOTHING; `--all` skips
  such a topic with a loud per-topic warning. The per-agent forms (`stop <agent> <topic>`,
  `--pairs`) stay ungated — they name specific agents, which is the sanctioned detached teardown.
  **Rejected:** silently excluding the hub's own worker dir from the topic teardown. It would leave a
  live supervisor standing over its own dead workers and report success, which is a worse lie than a
  refusal; and directive prose alone protects only the obedient path.

### Parked means "nothing but progress since the question" (0.5.87, issue #242)

A detached run on `iris-runtime` (2026-09-06) parked a `question` at 01:30Z and then, still waiting,
appended a `progress` event reading "Operator question still open". `jobProgress` parked a question
only while it was the NEWEST event, so that heartbeat un-parked the record: `job relay` refused with
"nothing is parked (last event: progress)", and the origin fell back to writing the hub's inbox with
`send --from hub` and hand-writing `_job/cursor.txt` — without the relay's cursor, every re-armed
`job wait` re-reported the question it had already answered. Nothing in the job-hub identity block
forbids progress while parked, and the worker block asks for periodic progress, so the protocol was
what was wrong, not the run.

A question is now parked while the hub has emitted nothing but `progress` since it: `jobProgress`
scans back from the newest event, past any run of `progress`, and parks the `question` it lands on.
An `ack` — the hub picking up the relayed answer — a terminal event, or anything else after the
question still un-parks it. The consumed check that stops `job status` from re-reporting an answered
question moved with it: it compares the relay's cursor against `newestQuestionEnd` (the byte offset
just past the newest `question` line) instead of the outbox's current size, because progress the hub
logs after the relay and before its `ack` grows the outbox past the cursor and would otherwise
re-park a question that was already answered. The relay's own cursor is unchanged — still the byte
size of the snapshot it read, which now ends at the last progress rather than at the question, so an
event appended during the send still lands beyond it and the next `job wait` still sees it.

A relayed answer is sent with `--no-done-instruction`. The job hub's `done` is the run's terminal
event — the origin acts on it and `job stop` kills the session — so the generic "when done, append a
done event" footer that `send` appends to an ordinary worker's inbox is a hazard here: it invites the
hub to end the whole run on the next thing it finishes. The accept path is now tested through an
injected send, the way `waitRun` takes injected deps: `relayRun` is exported and takes the send
function as a defaulted second parameter, so a test can assert the exact argv and the cursor the
relay writes without touching a pane.
