# Forensics as GitHub issues — design

**Date:** 2026-08-30
**Version:** 0.5.62
**Scope:** `src/core/forensics.ts` backend swap (file → GitHub issue, with an offline queue and an
ask-once consent gate), one new `reflect` entry, `src/commands/review.ts` re-based on `gh issue`,
one-paragraph directive changes in six `commands/*.md` + a rewrite of `commands/review.md`, tests.
**Wire protocol untouched.**
**Provenance:** grilled 2026-08-30 (16 questions over 4 rounds); `/codex:adversarial-review` on the
first draft returned 8 findings, all 8 execution-verified as real by an independent Opus panel and
folded in below (§A run record, §C queue, §D scrub, §E triage, §G consent, §H tests, §F corpus).

## Problem

Every ap command records what went wrong at teardown (`captureArtDir`), on spawn failure
(`captureSpawnFailure`) and whenever the hub flags something (`recordHubFlag`) — all into
`~/.ap/forensics/<date>/*.md` on the box that ran the command (`src/core/forensics.ts:152`).
`/ap:review` then surveys those files, clusters them by a normalized signature, accrues a lifetime
trend ledger and files them under `.reviewed/`. Measured over three months (97 local records, 140 on
xjp):

- Feedback is **box-local**. The maintainer has to ssh into every box that runs ap (today xjp, via a
  standing rule) to see what happened there; a teammate's box is invisible.
- The trend machinery does not cluster: `.trends.json` holds 223 signatures for 243 events (92 %
  singletons) because `hub_flag`/`part_note` prose never normalizes to the same key.
- Four of the eight scrapers (`audit_log`, `status`, `spawn_results`, `session_log`) have never
  produced a finding.
- The record and the fix live in different places: the fix is a PR on
  `WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform`, the evidence is a markdown file nobody links from it.

## Goal

An ap problem becomes a **GitHub issue on `WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform`** the moment it is
observed, from whichever box and user ran the command — after that box's user has said **yes once**
to filing there — with one issue per run, mid-run flags and the hub's reflection as comments on it,
full debugging detail (the users are teammates), and only credential-shaped strings scrubbed. Filing
never blocks or fails a run: every `gh` call is time-boxed, the record is written to a local queue
*before* the call and removed after it succeeds, and the queue is flushed later by the next successful
filing or by `/ap:review`. `/ap:review` becomes triage over the open issues (cluster, suggest, hand
off to `/ap:quick` with `Closes #n`, mark `triaged`); the local trend ledger, `.reviewed/` archive
and the remote-box ssh pull are retired.

## Architecture

### A. The run issue

**Tracker.** One exported constant `AP_ISSUES_REPO = "WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform"`
(`src/core/forensics.ts`), passed as `--repo` on **every** `gh issue` / `gh label` invocation — the
verbs' and the directive's alike. `gh` otherwise infers the repo from the *caller's* checkout
(`Runner` is cwd-bound and every verb `chdir`s to the target repo), which would file a teammate's
run into their project's tracker. With `--repo`, filing also works when cwd is not a git repo.

**Run record** = `<artDir>/issue.txt` (the command's own `_<suite>` art dir — `_quick`, `_design`,
`_implement`, `_explore`, `_autoresearch`, `_bridge`), written at FIRST contact with `run_id` only
and gaining `number`/`url` when a create lands. Not the topic dir: it is shared by every command on
that slug and is never archived or removed (`archiveTopic` moves only `_<suite>`,
`src/core/archive.ts:61-75`), so design→implement on one slug would inherit the design run's issue
and `reflected=1`. No init resets it: every init refuses a slug whose art dir already exists
(`topic already in flight`, rc 2), so a repeated slug never re-enters a live record.
```
run_id=<repo_hash[:8]>-<topic_slug>-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ of first filing>
number=<issue number>        (absent while queued)
url=<issue url>              (absent while queued)
reflected=1                  (present once the reflection comment is posted)
```
**Spawn failures are their own run**: `spawn` is a CLI verb invoked from the directives with no
owning command in-process, so `captureSpawnFailure` keeps its signature and records at
`workerDir(agent, model, topic)/issue.txt`, title `[ap:spawn] <reason>`.

**Create-or-comment.** All four kinds go through one function
`fileFinding(kind, run, title, body, r = forensicsRunner())`:
- no `issue.txt` → **create** under a per-run lock (`openSync(join(artDir, "issue.lock"), "wx")`;
  a second concurrent filer that loses the lock waits for `issue.txt` or queues) →
  `gh issue create --repo <R> --title <T> --body <B>`; on success write `issue.txt`.
- `issue.txt` with `number` → **comment**: `gh issue comment <n> --repo <R> --body <B>`.
- `issue.txt` without `number` (an earlier filing queued) → queue this one too (§C).

**Title** = `[ap:<command>] <first finding, normalized, ≤80 chars>` — the flag text (flag-created
issue), the spawn-failure reason, or the first mechanical finding key — normalized by the existing
`normalizeVolatile` (`src/core/review.ts:41`) so the same failure on two boxes produces the same
title. `topic` is in the body, not the title.

**Dedup on create.** `gh issue list --repo <R> --state open --search "in:title \"[ap:<command>]\""
--json number,title --limit 100`; an exact title match → comment there (`seen again — run <run_id>
on <hostname>` + body) and record that number. Closed issues never match. A triaged-but-open issue
*does* match — the recurrence comment is what makes it untriaged again (§E). `gh` failing at the
lookup → skip dedup, create. The cross-run same-title race (two boxes creating in the same second)
is accepted: `clusterByTitle` absorbs it.

**Issue body** (create): metadata block, then the record.
```markdown
<!-- ap-forensics run=<run_id> cmd=<command> v=<version> kind=<kind> -->
### Run
| | |
|---|---|
| ap version | <version> |
| command | <command> |
| topic | <topic text, verbatim> |
| run id | <run_id> |
| host / user | <os.hostname()> / <os.userInfo().username> |
| platform | <process.platform> · node <process.version> |
| providers | <agent:provider, … from the worker dirs present> |
| repo | <origin URL with any userinfo stripped, else repo_hash> |
| art dir | <abs path> |
| filed at | <ISO Z> |

### <Mechanical findings | Spawn failure | Flag>
<the record body, verbatim in today's `- **<source>** <key> _(source: …)_` bullet schema>
```
Comments carry the marker line `<!-- ap-forensics run=<run_id> kind=flag|reflection|findings -->`
and the record body. Labels are **not** applied by the verbs (non-collaborators cannot label).

**Kinds.** `findings` (teardown; only when ≥1 finding — a clean run files nothing), `spawn_failure`,
`flag` (`recordHubFlag`, incl. the internal callers at `implement.ts:275`, `roundProtocol.ts:118`,
`phaseTable.ts:296/464`, `artifact.ts:249`), and the new `reflection` (§B).

**Local trace for autoresearch.** `fileFinding` also appends one line `<ISO> <kind>` to
`<artDir>/findings.log` (best-effort; for a hub flag with no art dir yet, `join(topicDir(topic),
"_" + command)`). `corpusDigestWith` (`src/commands/autoresearch.ts:1952-1984`) derives
`forensics_flags` from that file in each archived campaign dir instead of walking the dated
forensics tree (which stops existing); the `forensicsRoot` dep goes.

**Version.** Read at runtime from `package.json` beside the bundle
(`join(__dirname, "..", "package.json")`), fallback `unknown`.

### B. Hub reflection → comment

The hub Writes its 3-5 bullets to a temp file and runs `$CS <command> reflect <TOPIC> @<file>` →
`recordHubReflection` posts kind `reflection` and sets `reflected=1`; a second `reflect` for the same
run is refused with rc 1. With no `issue.txt` it prints `NO_RUN_ISSUE`, rc 0. Directive guidance:
"write for a teammate who will debug this from the issue alone: what the findings mean, what the hub
did, what you'd try first". No public-audience redaction rule (settled).

### C. Offline queue — queue-first, time-boxed, per-run ordered

**Runner.** Forensics has its **own** `forensicsRunner()` — `execFileSync` with `timeout: 15_000`
and `killSignal: "SIGKILL"`, stdin ignored; a timeout surfaces as a non-zero result (the existing
catch shape maps `ETIMEDOUT` to code 1). It is never the cwd-bound `gitwork` Runner (no opts slot,
no timeout). Every `gh` call in this spec goes through it.

**Queue-first.** `fileFinding` writes the queue record **before** its first `gh` call and deletes it
after the call succeeds; a hang, a hub `SIGTERM`, or a crash all degrade to "queued", never to a lost
record. Any non-zero `gh` exit — binary missing, unauthenticated, network, API, timeout — leaves the
record queued, logs one `warn` line naming the path, and returns 0. `runForensics`/`runFlag` print
`ISSUE=<url>` on success, `QUEUED=<path>` when queued, or `CONSENT=needed` (§G).

**Layout.** `~/.ap/forensics/queue/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.mmmZ>-<run_id>-<kind>-<pid><rand4>.md` (date
first so a queue spanning midnight sorts correctly; pid+rand4 makes same-millisecond concurrent
filers collision-free — the `atomicWrite` idiom). Frontmatter: today's keys + `queued: true`,
`kind`, `run_id`, `attempts: <n>`, `title:` (creates only), and the identity block.
`~/.ap/forensics/queue/map.txt` holds `run_id → number` for runs whose art dir is gone.

**Flush** (`review flush`; also attempted automatically **after** the current record's own filing,
bounded by **30 s wall clock**, full drain only in `review flush` with progress output): group
records by `run_id`; per run replay the create (the record carrying `title:`) first — with dedup —
then its comments in name order; runs are independent, so one run's failure aborts only that run's
remaining records and the flush continues with the others. A failed record's `attempts` is bumped;
at 3 it is renamed `.failed` (dead letter) with one `warn` line. A crash after GitHub accepted a
comment but before the local delete replays it once — accepted (dedup-on-create downgrades a
duplicate create to "seen again"; a duplicate comment is harmless). On the happy path nothing stays
under `~/.ap/forensics/`.

### D. Secret scrub — best-effort denylist

Every posted line (title, body, comment) passes `scrubSecrets`: `gh[posur]_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`,
`github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}`, `sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}`, `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`, `(?i)bearer\s+\S+`,
`(?i)\b(token|password|passwd|secret|api[_-]?key)\s*[=:]\s*\S+`, URL userinfo
`://[^/\s:@]+:[^/\s@]+@` → `://<redacted>@`, and PEM blocks
`-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----[\s\S]*?-----END [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----`. The value becomes
`<redacted>`. This **reduces, it does not bound**: unlabelled high-entropy strings, Slack `xox*`, JWTs
and confidential prose still pass — which is why filing is gated by consent (§G). Nothing else is
redacted (settled Q12a/Q13): paths, hostnames, usernames, topic text, worker prose and JSON events
post verbatim; the origin URL posts with userinfo stripped (the one identity field that mechanically
carries a credential).

### E. `/ap:review` = triage over issues

`review survey [--since <Nd|Nh>] [--command <name>]` (verb name kept; new backend):
1. `review flush` first (bounded as in §C — the survey reports `QUEUE=<remaining>`).
2. One call: `gh issue list --repo <R> --state open --search "in:title \"[ap:\"" --json
   number,title,createdAt,labels,comments,url --limit 200`. **Client-side triage predicate**: an
   issue is *triaged* iff (it carries the `triaged` label OR a comment whose first line is
   `<!-- ap-triaged at=<ISO> -->`) AND no `<!-- ap-forensics …` comment is newer than the newest
   triage marker. So a recurrence on a triaged issue makes it untriaged again, and the
   non-collaborator comment fallback counts exactly like the label. `--since` compares the newest
   ap-marker comment time (else `createdAt`). Output: one TSV row per untriaged issue
   `<number>\t<title>\t<comments>\t<last_event>\t<url>`, then `TRENDS` with one row per
   normalized-title cluster having ≥2 open issues or ≥1 "seen again" comment:
   `<title>\t<open>\t<seen_again>\t<first>\t<last>`. `--all` is removed.
3. Zero rows → the directive prints "no untriaged ap issues; ap has been healthy".

`review archive <number>…` (name kept): `gh issue edit <n> --repo <R> --add-label triaged`
(best-effort `gh label create triaged --repo <R>` once); when labelling fails (no rights) it posts
the marker comment `<!-- ap-triaged at=<ISO> -->\ntriaged by /ap:review` instead. One shared marker
constant in `src/core/review.ts`. Closing stays the maintainer's call (`gh issue close --repo <R>`).

`review consent yes|no` — §G. `review flush` — §C.

The directive (`commands/review.md`) rewritten: consent check → survey → read each issue
(`gh issue view <n> --repo <R> --json number,title,body,comments --jq <render>`) → cluster → per cluster one action and the hand-off
`/ap:quick "<fix>. Closes #<n>"` (or `/ap:implement` when it needs a spec) → present → archive the
reviewed numbers. The remote-box ssh pull is dropped (every box files its own issues).

### F. Deletions

- Scrapers `scrapeAuditLog`, `scrapeStatus`, `scrapeSpawnResults`, `scrapeLogs` (never fired).
- The trend ledger (`.trends.json`, `accrue`, `parseTrendLedger`, `findingSignature`'s per-source
  branches except `normalizeVolatile`), `reviewedTarget`, `.reviewed/`, recursive `walkForensics`,
  `--all`, the dated `<date>/<time>-<name>.md` layout and `freeFeedPath` (its same-second guard is
  replaced by the pid+rand4 queue name).
- `corpusDigestWith`'s `forensicsRoot` walk (replaced by `findings.log`, §A).
- The standing rule "ap:review must include remote-box forensics" (memory; update after ship).

Existing `~/.ap/forensics/<date>/` and `.reviewed/` trees are left in place; nothing reads them.
No migration of pre-0.5.62 records.

### G. Consent — ask once per box

Filing to a public tracker is gated at the **single choke point**: `fileFinding` and `flushQueue`
both read `~/.ap/issues-consent` (one line, `yes` or `no`, written by `review consent yes|no`).
- `yes` → file. `no` → never shell out; records are written to the queue dir as today's local file
  and `runForensics`/`runFlag` print `QUEUED=<path>` (the local-file behaviour, permanently).
- **absent** → queue the record and print `CONSENT=needed`. The directives handle it once: at the
  forensics step of an attached run, and at the start of `/ap:review`, on `CONSENT=needed` fire
  **AskUserQuestion** (Header `Issues`): *"ap files run diagnostics as issues on the public repo
  github.com/WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform — one issue per run with the topic, hostname,
  username, paths, worker output and hub notes, for every repo you run ap in from this machine.
  Allow?"* — `Allow (recommended for the team)` / `Never on this machine` / `Not now`. Allow →
  `$CS review consent yes` then `$CS review flush`; Never → `$CS review consent no`; Not now →
  nothing (asked again next time). Mid-run flags never ask; detached jobs never ask (they queue).
- `AP_FORENSICS_BACKEND=queue` (env) forces the queue path regardless of consent — fail-closed, used
  by the test setup (§H).

README's "Security posture" block gains one clause naming that ap files run diagnostics as public
GitHub issues after a one-time per-machine consent, and how to decline (`ap review consent no`).

### H. Test seam — no test may reach live `gh`

- `fileFinding(..., r = forensicsRunner())`: unit tests pass a fake runner and assert exact argv.
- `tests/helpers/setupEnv.ts` (already wired in `vitest.config.ts`) sets
  `process.env.AP_FORENSICS_BACKEND = "queue"`; the real backend honours it before any `gh` call,
  so the five internal flag callers and the `dist/ap.cjs` child processes that inherit `process.env`
  (`tests/turn-confirm.test.ts:491` etc.) all land in the queue dir, never on GitHub.
- The three helper readers that walk `<forensics>/<date>/<file>` (`tests/turn-confirm.test.ts:85-93`,
  `tests/artifact-completeness.test.ts:60-66`, `tests/implement-cmd.test.ts:409-412`) are
  re-pointed at the flat queue dir; the `tests/implement-cmd.test.ts:330` stdout pin moves to the
  `QUEUED=` line.

## Components

- `src/core/forensics.ts` — `AP_ISSUES_REPO`; `forensicsRunner()` (15 s timeout); keep the three
  entry-point signatures; `fileFinding(kind, run, title, body, r?)` with lock, dedup, queue-first,
  consent + env gate, `findings.log` line; `recordHubReflection` + `runReflect`; `runIdentity()`
  (version / hostname / user / platform / node / providers / origin-stripped); `issueTitle`,
  `renderIssueBody`, `renderComment`, `scrubSecrets`; `queueRecord`, `flushQueue(r, { maxMs })`,
  `map.txt`; `readConsent`/`writeConsent`; `issue.txt` read/write; remove the four scrapers.
  `runForensics`/`runFlag` print `ISSUE=`/`QUEUED=`/`CONSENT=needed`.
- `src/core/paths.ts` — `forensicsQueueDir()`, `issuesConsentPath()`.
- `src/core/review.ts` — keep `normalizeVolatile`, `parseMechanicalFindings`; delete the ledger; add
  `AP_TRIAGED_MARKER`, `isTriaged(issue)`, `lastEventAt(issue)`, `clusterByTitle(issues)`.
- `src/commands/review.ts` — `survey` (flush + one `gh issue list` + predicate + TSV/TRENDS),
  `archive` (label / marker-comment fallback), `flush`, `consent yes|no`; `--since`/`--command`
  kept, `--all` removed.
- `src/commands/{quick,design,implement,explore,autoresearch,bridge}.ts` — init resets
  `<artDir>/issue.txt`; dispatch case `reflect <TOPIC> @<file>` → `runReflect(command, topic, file)`.
- `src/commands/spawn.ts` — spawn-failure run record under the worker dir (signature unchanged).
- `src/commands/autoresearch.ts` — `corpusDigestWith` counts `findings.log` lines per archived
  campaign; `forensicsRoot` dep removed.
- `commands/{quick,design,implement,explore,autoresearch,bridge}.md` — forensics step surfaces
  `ISSUE=`/`QUEUED=`/`CONSENT=needed` (+ the consent AskUserQuestion, attached runs only);
  reflection step → `$CS <cmd> reflect <TOPIC> @<file>` with the teammate-audience guidance;
  `## Flagging suspicions` says flags become comments on the run's issue (queued offline / before
  consent). `commands/review.md` rewritten per §E + §G. `commands/job.md` (detached): never ask.
- `README.md` — the security-posture clause (§G).
- **Tests** (fresh `AP_HOME`, fake runner, `AP_FORENSICS_BACKEND=queue` in setup):
  - `tests/forensics-issue.test.ts` (new): create argv incl. `--repo` from a cwd that is an
    unrelated repo; comment argv; lock (second concurrent create waits/queues, one issue); dedup
    (fake list match → comment argv + number recorded; triaged-but-open still matches); queue-first
    (record exists before the runner is called, gone after success); non-zero / timeout-shaped
    runner result → queued, rc 0, warn; flush grouping by run, create-before-comment across a UTC
    midnight, per-run failure isolation, `attempts` → `.failed` at 3, bounded auto-flush; two filings
    in one ms → two queue files; `scrubSecrets` table (incl. PEM, URL userinfo, `ghs_`);
    `issueTitle` normalization; identity block; `runReflect` once then rc 1, `NO_RUN_ISSUE`;
    consent absent → `CONSENT=needed` + queued, `no` → queued forever, `yes` → filed; env guard
    wins over consent; `findings.log` line per kind; spawn-failure run under the worker dir;
    same-slug sequential runs → two issues; design→implement on one slug → two issues, implement's
    `reflect` not refused.
  - `tests/forensics*.test.ts`, `tests/quick-forensics.test.ts` — re-pointed; deleted-scraper cases
    removed. The three helper readers re-pointed (§H).
  - `tests/autoresearch-corpus.test.ts` — seeds `prior/findings.log` instead of a fake forensics tree.
  - `tests/review-core.test.ts`, `tests/review-cmd.test.ts` — `isTriaged` predicate table (label,
    marker comment, recurrence newer than marker → untriaged), `lastEventAt`, `clusterByTitle`,
    survey TSV/TRENDS over a fake issue list, `--since`/`--command`, archive argv + fallback comment,
    consent verb, `--all` rejected, every argv carries `--repo WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform`.
  - `tests/review-directive.test.ts` (new, whitespace-collapsed pins): each command's `.md` names
    `<cmd> reflect <TOPIC> @`, `ISSUE=`, `QUEUED=`, `CONSENT=needed`; `commands/review.md` carries
    `review flush`, `review consent`, `Closes #`, `--add-label triaged`, `--repo
    WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform` on its `gh` lines, and no `ssh`/`xjp`/`.reviewed`;
    `commands/job.md` says detached runs never ask for consent.
- `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — 0.5.62;
  `dist/ap.cjs` rebuilt and committed by the hub.

## Testing

Pure unit tests as enumerated; the `gh` boundary is the fake runner's recorded argv, the file
boundary is a fresh `AP_HOME`, and the env guard — enforced inside `forensicsRunner` itself, so it
covers `review survey`/`archive` as well as filing — makes live `gh` unreachable from any test or
child process. Live: the first ≥0.5.62 `/ap:quick` on this box (one deliberate `flag`) must ask
for consent once, then show one issue with the identity block, the flag/findings/reflection
comments, `issue.txt` under `_quick`; `/ap:review` lists it, `archive` labels it; a second run on
the same slug opens a second issue; then the same on xjp.

## Success Criteria

- `npm run typecheck`, `lint`, `test` green; `dist/ap.cjs` fresh; stale-token gate untouched.
- Every `gh` argv in `src/` and in `commands/review.md` carries `--repo WingsOfPanda/agglomeration-platform`.
- A run with findings/flags produces exactly one open issue `[ap:<command>] …` with the metadata
  block, one comment per flag/findings/reflection, and `<artDir>/issue.txt`; a clean run files and
  writes nothing; two runs on one slug → two issues.
- With no consent → nothing posted, `CONSENT=needed`, queued; `no` → never posted; `yes` → posted.
- With `gh` absent, failing or hung (15 s) → rc 0, one queue record, run unaffected; `review flush`
  drains in run order, dead-letters a permanently failing record, and never blocks on it.
- The same failure on two boxes → one issue plus a `seen again` comment; a recurrence on a triaged
  issue shows up in the next survey.
- Credential patterns in §D never reach GitHub (table-tested); origin posts without userinfo.
- No code path writes `~/.ap/forensics/<date>/`, `.reviewed/` or `.trends.json`; `forensics_flags`
  in the autoresearch corpus keeps counting.
- No test can spawn live `gh` (env guard set in setup and enforced at the `gh` boundary itself;
  asserted by a test that unsets consent and checks the runner was never invoked).

## Non-goals (settled — do not re-propose)

- A private feedback repo / making the plugin repo private (Q2); body-level redaction beyond §D
  (Q6/Q12/Q13); a config knob instead of the ask-once consent (Q16).
- Keeping a full local copy on the happy path (Q14); per-finding or per-signature issues (Q3);
  the hub running `gh` from the directive for filing (Q4); failing a run when filing fails (Q5);
  `flag --private` (Q9); verb-applied labels (Q10); migrating pre-0.5.62 records; the four
  never-firing scrapers (Q15).
- A locked idempotent journal for the queue — dedup-on-create plus the per-run lock and per-run
  flush ordering cover the real cases; the cross-run same-title double-create and the
  crash-after-success duplicate comment are accepted.
- Fixing `archive.ts:74`'s `rmSync(td, { recursive: false })` (throws EISDIR even on an empty topic
  dir — pre-existing, out of scope).

## Amendments

### The read step uses `--json` (0.5.88, 2026-09-06)

The directive's step 4 shipped as `gh issue view <n> --repo <R> --comments`. On gh 2.45.0, the release
Ubuntu packages and every box in the fleet runs, that form and the plain `gh issue view <n>` both fail
with `GraphQL: Projects (classic) is being deprecated ... (repository.issue.projectCards)`: the
human-readable view still queries the retired Projects (classic) fields. The two triage runs of
2026-09-06 read the issues through `gh api repos/<R>/issues/<n>` by hand instead. The step now uses
`gh issue view <n> --repo <R> --json number,title,body,comments` with a `--jq` render of the title,
the body and each comment in order; `--json` requests only the fields it names, so it works on every
gh release, and the verb stays `gh issue view` (the directive test's `--repo` check covers it). The
verbs the platform runs itself (`review survey`, `review archive`, the forensics filing) never used
the failing form and are unchanged.

### Spawn failures carry the pane tail; dead panes keep their screen (0.5.93, issue #195)

Three codex spawns died at bootstrap on two boxes between 2026-09-01 and 09-03. Every filed issue
said `reason=pane_dead` and named a failure report, and nothing else — the operator could not tell an
OAuth prompt from an OOM from a bad `--model`. Two gaps, and BOTH had to close: the tail was never
filed, and for `pane_dead` there was no tail to file.

**P1 — file it.** `captureSpawnFailure` takes `paneTail?`; when it is non-empty a third finding
`pane_tail=<encoded>` joins `reason=` and `failure_report=`. `bootstrapFailed` passes the capture it
already took for stderr (25 lines, before the pane is killed) — never a second `capture-pane`, which
would run after the kill and answer "". The value is scrubbed and THEN encoded: every denylist
pattern in §D is written against plain text and could not match a percent-encoded `token%3D…`. It is
percent-encoded because a finding is ONE line and `review.ts`'s `BULLET` regex is line-anchored — a
raw tail line that happened to read `- **x** y _(source: z)_` would parse back out as a phantom
finding, and `n_findings_mechanical` would count it. Blank lines are dropped before the last 15 are
taken (a TUI pads its screen; fifteen blanks carry nothing). An empty or whitespace-only tail pushes
no bullet at all.

**P2 — make the tail exist.** tmux destroys a pane whose process exited, and `pane_dead` is declared
only after two failed liveness probes 15s apart, so `capture-pane` at capture time had nothing left
to read: the one real `pane_dead` report on file has a blank scrollback section. Every ap pane is now
created with `remain-on-exit on` (`paneRemainOnExitSet`, called inside `stampOrFail` right after both
ownership stamps take, so all three placement paths get it). It is best-effort: a pane that refuses
the option only loses its tail, which is today's behaviour, so a `false` warns and the spawn goes on.

Keeping the pane means pane PRESENCE is no longer a liveness answer, so the snapshot now answers two
questions under two names. The unforgeable id listing carries the dead column
(`#{pane_id}\t#{pane_dead}`) — never the option listing, whose values a pane can forge with a
newline. `livePaneNonces` / `paneOwned` stay OWNERSHIP and include dead panes (a dead pane is still
ap's, so `stop`, `job stop`, `sessionKillable` and the preflight sweep still reap it, and `kill-pane`
and `respawn-pane -k` both work on one); `alivePaneNonces` / `paneLive` are LIVENESS and drop them.
Which caller asks which:

| Caller | Question |
|---|---|
| `spawn` ready-wait probe, `waitLive`, `implementHold`, `phaseTable` guard leg (d), `send`'s nudge, `autoresearch experiment-send`'s nudge + `monitor`'s escape hatch | **live** — a dead pane must fail the wait fast, and typing into one accomplishes nothing |
| `classifyJobLiveness` (`job status`, `ap list`), `scanTopicWorkers` / `classifyWorkerLiveness` rule 3, `autoresearch resume`'s liveness pass, `quick init`'s stale-dir reap | **live** — these decide whether a worker is still running — and the OWNED map to kill the dead pane it reaps |
| `stop`'s batch, `job stop`'s `ownedPanes` + session sweep, `killPreflightOrphans`, `autoresearch drop-worker`, `ap list`'s `[ORPHAN]` column, `spawn`'s `--target-pane` respawn and `.last_pane` split target | **owned** — a dead pane is still ours to reap, respawn, or split from |

`pane_dead` is therefore detected exactly as before (two failed probes, 15s apart), and
`capture-pane` at that moment returns the real screen.

**Accepted side effect.** A worker TUI that exits on its own now leaves a `[dead]` pane on screen
until ap reaps it (`ap stop`, `ap job stop`, or the next `respawn-pane -k`). That is the price of the
tail, and it is visible rather than silent. The graceful-teardown path is unaffected: `killGraceful`
respawns the pane with the DONE banner and `teardownBatch` kills it 9s later. One reap had to grow a
kill to keep that promise true: `quick init`'s stale-predecessor archive moves the crashed worker's
dir, pane.json included, so it kills the dead pane before it archives the dir — otherwise the only
record that could ever name that pane is gone and dead panes accumulate across crashed quick runs.
It kills exactly the panes the ownership snapshot still lists under the nonce that dir recorded; a
recycled id, or one tmux no longer lists, is never touched, and a kill that throws is a warning that
does not stop the archive. The kill reaches only a pane tmux still lists under the recorded nonce: after a tmux server restart the pane is gone anyway, and the archive proceeds without it.

Which map each dep bag binds is pinned by IDENTITY tests — `READY_WAIT_DEPS.paneAlive` is
`paneLive`, `realWaitDeps().snapshot` is `alivePaneNonces`, `liveDeps().livePaneNonces` is
`livePaneNonces` — plus one PATH-shim test that drives the real probes against a tmux answering with
a dead pane and a live one. Behaviour cannot pin these: the two maps differ on exactly one pane
shape, dead-but-ours, so a probe rebound to the wrong map passes every fixture built from a live
snapshot. `ap list` reads both columns from a single `paneSnapshot()` rather than two back-to-back
scans that can disagree about a pane created or destroyed between them.

**Known and left as is.** The `failure_report=` path filed on the issue is the PRE-archive path: the
same failure archives the worker dir moments later (`<worker>-<ts>-FAILED/`), so the path on the
issue no longer resolves. The report itself survives under the archive, and the tail — now on the
issue — is the primary lead, so the path stays a hint rather than growing an archive-aware rewrite.
