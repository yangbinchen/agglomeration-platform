// tests/state-agreement.test.ts — the hub proves it resolved the tree the worker was given.
//
// PR G re-roots every verb family so one run touches one state tree. That rule now lives at nine
// dispatchers, and a rule at nine call sites is exactly the shape that rots when a tenth is added:
// #150 applied it to the `job` verbs and left the other eight, and the gap cost a field incident.
// This file is the mutation-locked invariant for it. The failure it pins is SILENT — send's
// inboxWrite and its nudge both derive from the same cwd, so they agree with EACH OTHER while both
// miss the worker, and only the worker's own refusal (the far side, after the write) ever objected.
//
// The oracle is the pane: the one reference hub and worker share that does not itself derive from
// the hub's cwd. spawn stamps the worker's own state dir there as @ap_state, beside @ap_nonce; send
// reads it back before it writes anything. Three-valued, and ABSENT is the row that matters —
// a pane from a pre-@ap_state release has nothing to compare, and refusing on that would strand
// every in-flight worker across the upgrade.
//
// Nothing here reaches tmux: the pane touches are injected, exactly as the ownership tests do it.
