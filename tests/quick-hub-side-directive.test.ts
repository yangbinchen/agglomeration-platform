// The quick hub (attached, or the detached job hub) does two grind-shaped things itself: gathering the

// delegation block (2026-09-05-worker-delegation-reminder-design.md, amendment "quick's hub side"):
// the gathering and the log reading are delegable; the brief, every citation and the gate run are the
// hub's own.
