// src/core/workerLiveness.ts — the I/O half of worker liveness: read the records a topic's worker
// dirs already hold, hand them to the PURE classifier in core/job.ts, and persist the one piece of
// state this layer owns (the consecutive-miss counter).
//
// Kept out of core/job.ts because that module's contract is "everything decidable from values
// alone", and out of commands/job.ts because `ap list` needs the same answer without importing the
// whole job verb (and its spawn/send/stop dependencies) to get it.
