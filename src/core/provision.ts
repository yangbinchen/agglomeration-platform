// src/core/provision.ts — worktree environment parity: detect a site-packages SHADOW of this repo and
// derive the PYTHONPATH pin that makes a run worktree import its own tree.
//
// A detached run works in `<root>/.ap/worktrees/<topic>`, but a path-configuration file in the
// operator's site-packages (`iriscortex-src.pth`, or a setuptools editable finder's MAPPING) resolves
// the package from the MAIN checkout for every interpreter on the box — torchrun children of a
// worktree pytest run included (issues #183, #197). PYTHONPATH is the one mechanism that survives
// every hop a real job crosses, so ap derives ONE pin here and applies it at the three places it
// chooses a cwd: the worker pane (`spawn`), the hub's own test re-run (`implement verify-tests`), and
// the brief a quick hub prefixes onto its own gate run.
//
// Pure: `fs` reads and string surgery. No interpreter is ever consulted and no subprocess runs. Every
// read sits inside a `try` — an unreadable or absent site dir is silence, and silence is today's
// behaviour (no pin, no warn), the safe direction for an advisory channel.
//
// ponytail: only the user site (`<home>/.local`), `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `CONDA_PREFIX` are scanned, never
// the system site dirs, and no interpreter is asked — the upgrade path is `site.getsitepackages()`
// from the job's own python, which costs a python subprocess ap does not have.
// ponytail: a PEP 660 backend that installs its finder at `sys.meta_path[0]` and writes no plain
// `.pth` is invisible to a textual scan; it degrades to today's behaviour.
// ponytail: with the venv AT the repo root (`python -m venv .`) the venv and the checkout are one
// directory, so nothing of the venv's outside its site dir is recognised as the environment's own:
// any such path a `.pth` line, a finder MAPPING or an exec line names (pip's VCS editables at
// `<root>/src/<pkg>`; a `lib64` entry) is reported as a shadow — the safe direction, since the pin
// drops any entry with no counterpart in the worktree and only warns; when nothing survives the drop
// the brief's pasteable probe then REFUSES until the hub exports PIN_BY_HAND (a shadow with no pin
// is not a clean box).
// ponytail: PYTHONPATH precedes the stdlib, so a pinned import root holding a stdlib-colliding
// top-level name (`types.py`, `select.py`) shadows it for every interpreter in the pane. Checked
// clean for the dogfood repo; written down rather than discovered later.
