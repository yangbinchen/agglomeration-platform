// src/core/phaseTable.ts — the worker-phase table for /ap:explore and /ap:design.
//
// A phase IS data: a state-file prefix, a status key, a timeout budget, an artifact path, a
// wait-outcome classifier, and (from openq onward) a dispatch-safety guard. It used to be encoded
// as ~50 lines of hand-copied control flow per phase — nine copies of one send/wait skeleton — so
// every wait-protocol change (the 0.5.5 liveness extension) had to be applied nine times, and the
// 0.5.5 VS-gap bug was exactly one missed slot in one hand-written copy. Here each phase is one
// PHASES row and the skeletons exist once: phaseSend (the send head) and dispatchPrompt (its tail),
// phaseWait (the whole wait body), surveyPhaseArtifact (the read every validator does before
// consuming a phase artifact), waitGateVerb (the gate read-out), rowFor (the phase map every verb
// that takes a phase as an argument resolves through), triad (the 3-positional arg parse).
//
// Byte-for-byte fidelity is the contract. Every log line, state-file write and rc below is the
// literal text the copied bodies emitted; the only per-phase variation is a row slot. What is NOT
// shared stays in commands/*.ts: each phase's prompt composer (it sits with its parser by design),
// its own preconditions, and each verb's arg-validation wording.
//
// A guard's chain verdict is a PRESUMPTION: it says "the worker may still be busy", inferred from
// history alone, and one expired wait used to end a worker's entire run that way. It is overridable
// — but ONLY by positive evidence that the worker is free (the 2026-08-08 lockout spec): the worker
// reported an idle status ITSELF (the spawn seed does not count), a terminal event landed past the
// failing phase's offset, that phase's artifact is settled, and its pane is alive. Silence is never
// evidence, and the rc-3 busy-gate downstream is NOT the backstop for this — it re-reads the same
// file through the same seam. Every layer records its own verdict and consumes other layers'
// recorded verdicts; none infers another's. The probe wraps the two encodings' shared consumer;
// neither encoding changes, and they stay unmerged.
//
// TWO guard encodings, deliberately not unified. `anyPriorUnsafe` (the ternary at openq /
// crossverify / adversary) reports the first unsafe tag anywhere in its chain; `latestNonSkipped-
// Unsafe` (the walk at rebuttal / gap / signoff) consults ONLY the latest non-skipped tag, so a
// clean later phase clears an older failure. On pipeline-reachable state they agree; on inputs the
// pipeline cannot produce (VS=ok alongside QS=timeout) they disagree, and each site keeps the
// answer it has always given. Merging them would be a behavior change and needs its own spec.
//
// Chain ORDER is load-bearing too: it decides which `KEY=value` the skip warning names when more
// than one earlier phase is unsafe. crossverify checks FS before QS (earliest first) while
// adversary checks VS, QS, FS (latest first) — both are transcribed from the shipped source, not
// derived from table order.

 *  - `skipTag` — a `<key>=skipped` phase (the dispatch guard's, or a zero-input skip) is reported as
 *    `skipped` before anything is judged.
 *
 *  ONE worker per call, deliberately: `artifactBackstop` WRITES (strike logs, hub flags, STILL_WRITING
 *  on stderr), and the callers differ in when they stop — six refuse the whole verb at the first
 *  `still-writing` while three finish the roster — so surveying a worker the caller would never have
