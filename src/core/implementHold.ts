// src/core/implementHold.ts — the premature-`done` HOLD for implement's turn wait
// (2026-09-04-parallel-slices-design.md, J).
//
// A worker that emits `done` after every plan task ended its turn at the FIRST one: the verify
// report did not exist yet, so the turn classified `failed` and the retry re-sent round 1 into a
// worker that was still implementing. The hold keeps that turn open — a report-less `done` re-arms
// the wait instead of ending it — and ends `failed` only once the worker's PANE has stopped
// changing, which is independent of the worker discipline that failed.
