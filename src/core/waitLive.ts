// src/core/waitLive.ts — the live wiring of outboxWaitSince's pane-liveness escape hatch.

// probe as an injected function; this is the one place that binds it to the real tmux probe).

/** Drop-in replacement for the wait verbs' live `outboxWaitSince` call: identical signature, but with
 *  a pane-liveness escape hatch wired in. Reads the worker's pane id from pane.json once at wait
 *  start; if pane.json is absent — or records no ownership nonce — the id is null and the wait
 *  degrades to the plain outbox-only poll (no behavior change). When the pane later vanishes with
 *  no terminal event, the wait returns a
 *  synthetic `error` event so the turn fails fast instead of blocking out the full turn budget.
 *  Conversely, a pane not confirmed dead at budget expiry extends the wait up to
 *  AP_WAIT_EXTEND_MULT x the budget — a live worker outrunning its budget is mid-turn, not dead.
 *  Knob semantics: default 3; set 1 to DISABLE (envNum's `|| def` means 0/unset also fall back
 *  to 3, so 1 is the only off-switch); clamped to <=10 so a typo cannot yield a multi-day wait. */
/** `onPoll` (last, optional) is forwarded straight into the wait's existing per-`everyS` poll — the
 *  seam `job wait` uses to run its worker classifier at the pane probe's cadence. Omitted by every
 *  other caller, and omitted it changes nothing: the wait is the wait it always was. */

  // instead of failing fast. It is also DEAD-checked (`paneLive`): every ap pane carries
  // `remain-on-exit on`, so the pane of a worker that exited stays listed and stays ours. A pane.json with no nonce disables the check exactly as an ABSENT one
  // does (paneId null -> plain outbox-only poll): the probe could only ever answer false for it, and
  // "unverifiable" is not "dead" — enabling it would fabricate a pane-died error ~30s into every
  // wait on a live pre-0.5.30 worker.
