// src/core/implementScope.ts
//
// SCOPE-CONFORMANCE guard for `implement` Phase A. Port of the prior bash plugin's scope-conformance
// helpers (deploy-scope), EXTENDED in ap (deliberate divergence) three times:
//   - docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-perform-scope-bullets-design.md — extractComponentsPaths also
//     reads bullet-list Components, not only markdown table rows.
//   - docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-implement-scope-prose-and-sibling-design.md — extraction also
//     reads PROSE lines in the section (every path-like token, not just bullets), and
//     matchDiffAgainstComponents tolerates a declared bare filename (basename match) and a
//     same-directory sibling of a declared file (one directory level), so a worker that renames or
//     splits a module in place is not flagged out-of-scope.
//   - docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-scope-testing-paths-design.md — scope checks treat paths
//     named in `## Testing` as declared scope with the same matching semantics as Components.
// A separate addition (2026-08-14-components-path-lint-design.md) sits beside the guard rather than in
// it: lintComponentsPaths, the warn-only authoring-time check that every declared path exists in the
// checkout unless its line is tagged [on-box]. It never feeds the scope verdict.
// So does pathsInvisibleInTarget (2026-08-23-worktree-truth-telling-design.md): the declared paths
// that exist in the MAIN checkout and are missing in a worktree run's target. Also warn-only, and
// also never part of the scope verdict.
// And so does testingBulletsWithoutPaths (2026-08-23-brief-path-correctness-design.md): how many
// `## Testing` bullets name no path at all, measured at `implement audit` so incomplete authoring is
// visible BEFORE a worker runs rather than as an OOS surprise at Stage 4. That same doc adds the
// decoration strip inside pathTokensFrom (paired emphasis + markdown links), which is widening-only.
// And so does unresolvedDeclaredPaths (2026-08-23-declared-path-precision-design.md): which declared
// tokens name neither a file nor an explicit directory. REPORT ONLY — it is computed ALONGSIDE the
// declared set that reaches matchDiffAgainstComponents and is never subtracted from it, because
// removing a declaration can only move a diff path from in-scope to OUT-of-scope (a passing check
// turned failing). That same doc drops a bare `/` token at extraction.
// deploy_extract_components_paths -> extractComponentsPaths,
// deploy_match_diff_against_components -> matchDiffAgainstComponents. The Bash helpers read files via
// awk; the TS ports take the already-read strings (file IO is the caller's concern). Table-row
// first-cell extraction, section bounds, separator/header skip, the path heuristic, and the exact /
// dir-prefix match rules are preserved; the prose/bullet token scan, the Testing-section scope rule,
// and the bare-name/sibling rules are the documented divergences. All new rules STRICTLY WIDEN
// in-scope — they can only suppress an OOS warning, never invent one, so they cannot turn a passing
// scope-check into a failing one.
// The same holds for 2026-09-06-scope-path-normalization-design.md: a trailing `:line` suffix is
// stripped at both token producers, `relativeForms` APPENDS the repo-relative form of a declared
// path written absolute under the target or the main checkout, and the warn-only lint gained two
// more skips (a line labelled `(new — does not exist yet)`, and a bare filename, which match rule 4
// keys on the basename rather than on a root-join).
