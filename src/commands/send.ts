 *  unit test, least of all the verb whose bug was typing into a stranger's shell. `paneState` is
 *  optional so a test that is not about the state guard needs no shim and reaches no tmux: an
 *  un-injected reader answers "" (unverified), the same proceed-anyway value an unstamped pane
 *  gives. The shipped path always injects the live reader. */
